          <b>Digital Downloads</b>
          <br>
              Digital Downloads are delivered immediately to the email you provided at purchase. Due to the nature of digital products, refunds and technical service cannot be provided. However, if you have a problem downloading, entered an incorrect email, or did not receive a link, you may email HERE and every attempt will be made to provide you with the product within the first two weeks of purchase. If you still are not able to retrieve the product, you may be offered the choice to receive the product in physical form if available, with the cost of shipping via United States Postal Service or United Parcel Service at your expense. You are responsible for backing up and maintaining your purchase for the future. Your downloads will not be replaced due to your loss of them, your computer failure or transition to a new device.
        </p>

              Technology is not always reliable, therefore, Karen Wade and Universal Harmonics, LLC can not guarantee that live events will be accessible. Every attempt is made to record all calls. In the event that a call is not available live, you will be provided access to the recording.
          <br>
              If all recording fails, or if an event is cancelled by Karen Wade at any time, you will be offered a full refund.

            <b>Private Sessions</b>
          <br>
              Cancellations received prior to 48 hours of a scheduled session will be refunded in full minus a 5% processing fee. Cancellations with less than 48 hours notice will not receive a refund.
          <br>
              If you miss a scheduled session for any reason, you will be granted one time to reschedule without penalty. If you miss a second scheduling, you will forfeit the session and no refund will be given.
          <br>
              Cancellations from either party are rare. Please note that if Karen Wade cancels or misses your session, every effort will be made to reschedule as soon as possible. If a new suitable time can not be found, you will be refunded the appropriate amount due. If a session is missed or rescheduled by the client, rescheduling will be accommodated at the normal booking time, generally about 8-12 weeks in advance.
