        <h4>The Conversation</h4>
        <p>Your subconscious programming shapes and drives your thoughts, which in turn create the story you project into the world. This energetic projection influences your reality, shaping the experiences you have. The world reflects back the energy you put out, reinforcing the patterns you're creating. If your subconscious is imprinted with experiences of disappointment, invalidation, trauma, or low self-worth, these influences will color your thoughts and, ultimately, the reality you experience.</p>
        <p>We want to get to the foundation of those imprints, connect with them, take that energetic imprint outside of our body as if it is its own person trying to tell us something and give it space to talk. Here is where The Conversation starts.<br/>
        ** What shape does the energy take? <br/>
        ** How old is it? <br/>
        ** What does it look like? <br/>
        ** What does it want to tell you? <br/>
        </p>
        <p>Now the conversation opens and the transformation begins. By connecting with the energetic imprint—giving it space to exist, to express itself, and to be met with understanding and compassion—it can begin to shift. This released energy then becomes a powerful resource, ready to be reintegrated into the body, uplifting our well-being and vitality.</p>
        <p>The Conversation is a healing modality based on acknowledging, connecting, and conversing with the parts of us that are hurting. By giving that part of us loving attention it reduces its power and thus it can transform. All parts of us want to transform to elevate who we are. We just need to give them the attention, love, and space to do so.</p>
        <p>In our 8-week program, I’ll guide you through unraveling and transforming your energetic imprints, creating space for healing and reintegration. As you release and shift these energies, you’ll notice your world changing — all because you are the one who is transforming</p><br/><br/>
